Purpose, Audience, Goal
This is a brief, high-level overview of what you intend to create. Your Personal Website Project should be relevant to your web development education, business venture, personal growth, professional field, or an area of personal interest. Have an idea to create something different? Cool! Please discuss it with your instructors.

In your milestone-1.php file, using valid HTML markup, compose no more than one brief statement for each of the following:

Purpose: What would you like your PWP to help you accomplish? This is a high-level goal akin to a Mission Statement.
Audience: Who will be using or viewing your site? Who is this site designed for, and who is your audience comprised of? Could it be for your professional peers and other developers, potential employers, customers, or clients, etc.?
Goal: This is should be a quantifiable goal if possible. For example, a goal for your PWP could be:
To acquire full or part-time employment or an internship.
To increase sales and/or conversion rates for an existing business.
To attract freelance clients.
To serve as a gallery to showcase and promote your work.
To increase the reach of a new or established social media presence (as measured via analytics tools).
