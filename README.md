# Milestone1

## Feedback
Great job on Milestone1. Purpose, audience, and Goal are well laid out. Your PWP will easily fall into the scope of the class. Persona accurately lays out just who will be using your site, and how he would be using your site. I think the simple easy to use site you laid out in the use case will make a great PWP.

## corrections
There is only one issue with Milestone1 is that you pushed a .idea directory to GitHub. Second, make sure to close all of your HTML tags. Lastly, while the layout for the site using HTML looks awesome I would like to see you start using a little more CSS for the layout of future projects. Also you have a .idea directory in the repository. That needs to be removed asap come let me know if you need help and I would check your .gitignore

# Milestone 2α

## Feedback

The formatting for milestone 2α was wrong. You should have had the wireframes in the page that you provided your content strategy. That being said, Your content as a whole was well thought out and I got a clear understanding of what you wanted to accomplish, and your goals should be very obtainable. I recommend that adding your logo to the nav-bar. Unless you have a very large logo having that much white space at the top would detract from the overall feel of the website. The about me section and Image section should be very easy to add and shouldn't take up to much time. Do you plan on using a third party tool to display your portfolio? If so I recommend that you use fancy-box from fancyapps.com. The plugin in is very easy to use and past alumni have had great results with using it. I am a little worried about how your personal website is going to look in mobile view. I love the Idea of adding a right justified photo next to the about me/ portfolio section but I am afraid that the photo might mess with the responsiveness of the site. I recommend writing a media query that hides the photo at certain screen size or moving it somewhere where the photo can stand out, and not distract attention away from the portfolio. That being said feel free to begin working on milestone 2β.
