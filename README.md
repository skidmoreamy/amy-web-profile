# Milestone1

## Feedback
Great job on Milestone1. Purpose, audience, and Goal are well laid out. Your PWP will easily fall into the scope of the class. Persona accurately lays out just who will be using your site, and how he would be using your site. I think the simple easy to use site you laid out in the use case will make a great PWP.

## corrections
There is only one issue with Milestone1 is that you pushed a .idea directory to GitHub. Second, make sure to close all of your HTML tags. Lastly, while the layout for the site using HTML looks awesome I would like to see you start using a little more CSS for the layout of future projects. Also you have a .idea directory in the repository. That needs to be removed asap come let me know if you need help and I would check your .gitignore
